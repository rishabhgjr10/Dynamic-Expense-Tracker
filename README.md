**Daily Expense Tracker**
This Daily Expense Tracker is a simple web application that allows you to manage your daily expenses based on a predefined daily budget. The tracker helps you stay within your budget by automatically adjusting future daily budgets based on over- or under-expenditure. It also logs your expenses date-wise starting from a specified date (such as when you receive your salary), making it easy to track your spending habits.

Features
Date-Wise Budgeting: Start tracking expenses from a custom date (e.g., salary day), instead of using fixed "Day 1, Day 2".
Dynamic Budget Adjustment: Automatically updates your next dayâ€™s budget based on how much you over- or under-spent.
Expense History: See all previous daily expenses and the corresponding budget for each day.
LocalStorage Support: Saves data locally, so your expense history and budget persist even if the tab is closed.
Responsive Design: Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.
